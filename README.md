# ComputerControlByTCP
A TCP server that controls your computer using C#

You can build Program.cs and it'll launch a TCP server on port 5000, you can implement the commands you want in your whitelist, as I did in the ExecuteCommand() function!

You can run the calls using this in powershell
```
./call.ps1
```

Ensure to update the token in both files!
